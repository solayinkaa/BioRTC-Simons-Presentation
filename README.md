# 🧠 Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron Model

**From Intuition to Simulation: A Hands-On Guide to Neuronal Dynamics**

This repository supports the computational neuroscience course presented at **BioRTC, Yobe State University**, featuring both theoretical explanations and Python-based simulations of the **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** and **generalized LIF (gLIF)** neuron models.

## 🔍 Overview

The Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model is a simplified yet powerful representation of how neurons process and transmit information. It mimics key neuronal behaviors:

* Membrane potential decay (leak)
* Integration of synaptic input over time
* Threshold-based spike generation
* Post-spike reset and refractory period

## 🎓 Presentation Highlights

* Passive Membrane Models (RC circuits)
* Integrate-and-Fire vs. Leaky Integrate-and-Fire
* Extension to Generalized LIF (gLIF): adaptation, dynamic thresholds
* Biological relevance and limitations
* Applications in neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks
* Real-time simulations using Python (Brian2) and PhET
