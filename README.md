This repository provides an overview and implementation of the **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron Model**, one of the foundational models in computational neuroscience.

## 🔍 Overview

The LIF model simulates how a neuron integrates incoming signals and generates spikes when a threshold is exceeded. It captures essential biological behavior while remaining computationally efficient.

Key features:
- Membrane potential decay (leak)
- Integration of input current
- Threshold-triggered firing and reset

## 📁 Contents

- **Python simulation scripts**
- **Jupyter Notebook with plots**
- **Extended models (e.g., gLIF)**
- **Slides and visual aids**
- **html file of leak bucket LIF illustration**

## 📘 Applications

- Computational Neuroscience education
- Spiking Neural Network simulations
- Neuromorphic engineering
